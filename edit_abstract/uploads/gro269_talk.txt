Sub-M_{Ch} white dwarfs as SN Ia progenitors

Supernovae are the main contributers of iron in our galaxy and influence the galactic chemical evolution. The moving mesh code AREPO [1] allows a parallel treatement of the occuring hydrodynamics and a nuclear network. It is used to simulate the double detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf as a possile progenitor of a Type Ia supernova. Different initial models are analysed for their evolution and final abundances in one and three dimensional simulations. An explosion in a double detonation scenario can lead to spectra and light curves that are in agreement with observations [2] and thereby it can give an insight into the origin of the elements in our galaxy.
