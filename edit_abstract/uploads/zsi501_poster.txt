Young stellar object are stars in the early stage of their evolution. They often show photometric variability, which may be due to non-steady accretion from the circumstellar disk onto the star, but other physical processes, such as rotating cold spots or the transit of a dust cloud can also change the observed brightness of the star. Variability is well examined at optical wavelengths, but nowadays more and more infrared data are available as well. The wavelength dependence of the variability carries information on the physical cause of the changing brightness. Here, we examine seven T Tauri-type stars known for their large amplitude variability selected from the Campaign 13 field of the Kepler K2 mission. We use nightly monitoring observations made with the 90 cm Schmidt telescope of Konkoly Observatory. We construct B, V, R, and I-band light curves and investigated the brightness and color variations of our targets, in order to establish the origin of the variability. In order to extend our wavelength coverage, cadence, and temporal coverage, we will complement these data with high-cadence, single broad-band optical filter light curves from K2, and 3.6 and 4.5 micrometer infrared photometry obtained with a nightly cadence with the Spitzer Space Telescope.
